# ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) Pipeline with Python and Pandas

## Overview

This project demonstrates the creation of an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline using Python and the Pandas library. The primary goal of this pipeline is to extract data from various sources, transform and consolidate the data, and finally, load it into a single CSV file for further analysis and use.

## Technology Used

- **Python**: The primary programming language used for building the ETL pipeline.

- **Pandas**: The Pandas library is employed to handle data manipulation, transformation, and consolidation tasks. It provides powerful data structures and data analysis tools.

- **Datetime Library**: Used for logging ETL steps, including extraction, transformation, and loading processes. It helps maintain a record of the pipeline's activities.

## The ETL Pipeline is Divided into Three Main Stages

### Extraction

In the extraction stage, data is collected from various sources. Replace the sample data sources (CSV, JSON, and XML) with your own data files. Ensure that your data sources are accessible and can be loaded into Pandas dataframes.

### Transformation

The transformation stage is where the customization happens. Modify the data extraction, transformation, and loading logic to fit your specific data requirements. Perform data cleaning, transformation, and any necessary operations to align the data with your needs. This may involve operations like filtering, aggregating, and combining datasets.

### Loading

The processed and transformed data is loaded into a single CSV file. This CSV file serves as the final output of the ETL pipeline. The consolidated data will be stored in a CSV file for your further use. Customize the loading logic to save the data in the desired format and location.
