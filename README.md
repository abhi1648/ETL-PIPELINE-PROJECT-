                                          **ETL Pipeline with Python and Pandas**

Overview
This project demonstrates the creation of an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline using Python and the Pandas library. The main goal of this pipeline is to extract data from various file formats, including CSV, JSON, and XML, transform and consolidate the data, and finally, load it into a single CSV file for further use.

Technology Used
Python: The primary programming language used for building the ETL pipeline.
Pandas: The Pandas library is employed to handle data manipulation, transformation, and consolidation tasks.
Datetime Library: Used for logging ETL steps, including extraction, transformation, and loading processes.
ETL Pipeline
The ETL pipeline is divided into three main stages:

Extraction: Data is extracted from various file formats such as CSV, JSON, and XML. The extracted data is loaded into Pandas dataframes for further processing.

Transformation: In this stage, data is cleaned, transformed, and combined from diverse sources into a single Pandas dataframe. Data cleaning and transformation tasks are performed to ensure data consistency and quality.

Loading: The processed data is consolidated into a single CSV file, which serves as the final output. This file can be used for various data analysis and reporting purposes.

Usage
To use this ETL pipeline for your own data sources, follow these steps:

Clone this repository to your local environment.
Ensure you have Python and the Pandas library installed.
Replace the sample data sources (CSV, JSON, and XML) with your own data files.
Modify the data extraction, transformation, and loading logic to fit your specific data requirements.
Run the Python script to execute the ETL process.
The consolidated data will be stored in a CSV file for your further use.
